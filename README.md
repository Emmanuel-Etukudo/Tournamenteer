# Tournamenteer
An Android application for managing local tournaments and amateur soccer games

# Problem Statement
For soccer tournaments that don’t get media attention (such as local high school and small college events), fans who are unable to physically be present at the event are left hanging.
Tournamentor allows fans/participants to monitor scores in real-time from anywhere in the world so they can to stay in the loop without having to be present.

Two user interfaces (admin and client). Admin creates an account and game pin to create and edit tournaments and games. Admins can create and edit participating teams, tournament information, score, and other key facets of the game live. 
Client users can join and view games using the game pin without the need for an account. Changes are reflected in real time via a clean and easy to navigate UI.
